    	<h2>Financial Matters</h2>
        <p>St. John The Evangelist School School is committed to keeping its unique education of academic excellence in a Christ-centered environment available to as many children as possible. 
		</p>
        <p>		Tuition fees at St. John The Evangelist School School are such that they cover the full cost of educating only the first child in a family. Families with multiple children receive discounted tuition rates for each additional child. Tuition assistance for siblings is computed at: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Second Child (20%)</li>
            <li>Third Child (45%)</li>
            <li>and Fourth Child (95%)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>		In addition to the financial assistance offered to multi-child families, financial aid is determined for those in need through TADS, an independent company which confidentially handles financial aid for Catholic school education. Families apply directly to TADS, either by a paper application or on-line, and the company notifies the Principal of St. John the Evangelist School as to a suggested amount/percentage of assistance for which each family is eligible. The School then determines what it is able to offer, and a familyâ€™s adjusted tuition rate will be determined for the year. </p>
      <p>		Families who have a student NEW to St. John the Evangelist School (even if there are currently enrolled siblings) are also eligible for funding through a local foundation, The BASIC Fund. Applications are available from the school office, and are based on financial need demonstrated by placement on an annual income scale. Families apply directly to The BASIC Fund, by a paper application, and the foundation will notify the Principal of St. John the Evangelist School as to the amount of assistance (up to $1600) for which a student may be eligible. The unique feature offered by this foundation is that if a NEW student is eligible for assistance, so are the currently enrolled siblings.</p>
