    	<h2>Grades 1-8</h2>
        <h3>Program</h3>
	<p>
		
St. John the Evangelist School is committed to providing a quality academic program that fosters critical thinking and competency in verbal and nonverbal skills in a Christ-centered environment. It is the school’s goal to meet the individual needs of each student, as much as possible, through a variety of learning experiences, and to facilitate the development of the student’s knowledge and organizational skills in order to achieve an integrated and structured understanding of information. St. John the Evangelist School focuses on the needs of the whole child as a valued and respected unique member of God’s family. Children are encouraged to develop and enhance their individual talents through a variety of academic and specialized programs offered at SDS. St. John the Evangelist School offers one class per grade level, each which accommodates up to 38 students. 

	</p>
		<h3>Grades 1-5</h3> 
	<p>

Grades 1-5 are self-contained, each with one full-time credentialed teacher and an instructional aide. Enrichment teachers come into the classroom for instruction, with the exception of fair-weather PE, which is held outside. Students attend computer classes in the computer lab, which has a full-time computer teacher/technology coordinator.  


	</p>
	<h3>Junior High</h3>
	<p>	Our Junior High program consists of students in Grades 6-8. Students have a homeroom and move from class-to-class for different subjects taught by different teachers. In addition to subject-area credentialed teachers, there is classroom and student support provided by two part-time teacher aides.  
</p>

<h3>Daily Schedule</h3>

<p>

Our entire school community begins each week with an assembly which includes prayer, flag salute, information sharing by the members of our Student Council, an explanation of the week’s Gospel message, and words from the Principal or Administrative Team. 

</p>
	<p>
		
The daily schedule at SDS includes morning and lunchtime recess. A regular day is scheduled from 8:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m., Monday-Thursday. Regular dismissal time on Fridays is 2:00 p.m., with the exception of the first Friday of each month which is scheduled for dismissal at 12:15 p.m.

</p>
<p>
		We offer a <a href="student_3.htm">hot lunch program</a>, with meals and salad bar available for purchase Monday-Thursday each week. Students must bring a lunch from home on Fridays. Milk is available for purchase separately with either program.
</p>
<p>
		
The academic program at St. John the Evangelist School is supported by professional and caring teachers who foster understanding and respect for the values of our Catholic community.
