      <h3>Additional Information about St. John’s Holiday Show of Hands</h3>
      <ul class="content-list multi-line-items"> 
        <li>This unique Christmas event has become the premier holiday show in the Sacramento Area.</li>
        <li>Originated 30 years ago as a fund raiser for the school.</li>
        <li>Began very small – 20 crafters in the school gym.</li>
        <li>Over the years has expanded to include over 150 vendors.</li>
        <li>Show now occupies 5 buildings and 10 classrooms.</li>
        <li>With the popularity of vintage collections, antiques and collectibles were added to the show nine years ago.</li>
        <li>Last year our Antique Cottage and our Fashion Pavilion were big hits with shoppers.</li>
        <li>New vendors are added to the show each year. This keeps the show fresh and enjoyable.</li>
        <li>Jurying for the show takes place the first Wednesday in March each year. Potential vendors are to bring samples of their work or collections to St. John’s Parish Hall, 5701 Locust Avenue, from 9am – 4pm. Further information: 916-481-8845, ext 216.</li>
        <li>This year’s show is full.</li>
        <li>All proceeds benefit St. John the Evangelist School.</li>

    	</ul>
      <h3>How to become a Vendor at St. John’s Craft Fair</h3>
      <p>St. John’s Holiday Show of Hands has over 150 crafters.  Each year the top 75% of our vendors are invited to return.  With approximately 25 spaces available yearly, we are always seeking exciting new crafts for our show.</p>
      <p>We invite interested crafters to bring a few samples of their work to be viewed by members of our Craft Fair committee on the first Wednesday in March from 9am to 4pm in our hall.  We also ask you to bring a stamped, self-addressed envelope and a snapshot or two of your crafts which we may keep.</p>
      <p>The jurying does not take very long.  We generally have three tables going…one crafter showing items to the committee, one packing his/her samples, and one unpacking his/her crafts.  You do not need to leave your samples.  We do not schedule appointments.</p>
      <p>Craft Fair vendors pay a space fee and a commission to St. John’s School.  Most of our spaces are approximately 8’ x 8’.  All vendors are required to have a seller’s permit from the California State Board of Equalization and are responsible for collecting and reporting any applicable sales tax.</p>
      <p>In late April applications are mailed to those crafters for whom we have space.  Others are informed their information is being placed in a file of vendors to call if another crafter opts not to participate in our next show which will be held the first weekend in December each year.</p>
      <p>Though we see many very nice crafts, we are unable to accept everyone who would like to participate.  We try very hard to have a variety of crafts and not to have many duplicates.  Our selections often depend upon the location of booth openings.</p>
      <p>For further information, please call St. John’s School: <b>916-481-8845</b>, ext <b>216</b>.  Thank you for your interest in our Holiday Show of Hands.</p>
